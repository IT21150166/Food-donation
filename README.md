# Food-donation #

**Problem** â€“
A large amount of food is wasted per day, while the number of people who do not have even a single meal is increasing, and the number of hungry people is increasing.

**Solution** -
This food donation website is useful for bringing wasted food to people who are starving and undernourished.
That means a lot of people will find leftovers during birthday parties, weddings, and other fun events (especially in restaurants). 
At that time, if the food is registered on our website for certain people, we will get it through our staff and share the information related to the food on our website. 
Then food will be distributed when those in need request it.
Also our website is to reduce the number of hungry people by taking it to nearby orphanages or old people's homes or beggars in cases where someone doesn't request their food.
We will create personal social media for our website and bring important things to the people through our website.
Thus the chances of this website being used by well-intentioned people and companies and restaurants are high.
This will reduce the number of hungry people as much as possible and avoid food wastage.
